i just spent a 100 hours deep diving into Maltbot let me explain why people are excited about it and what does it actually do most AI tools just assist and they just ask you questions maltbot acts and takes actions for you imagine you explaining a goal and then it actually just does it for you imagine you just had a meeting with Bob and you had the AI notes taken and while you're out and about you thought of a great idea you can message more bot from your phone tell it to look for the meeting notes you just had with Bob look at what the action items are supplement it with some research generate a draft deck and then send it back to Bob and somehow remember who Bob is from your previous history and that's what Maltbot can do for you it's basically an AI agent that has full control of your computer so it can access the browser your folders your files and do all these things you can do on a computer for you doesn't stop the suggestions it actually acts if chap GPT was a brain Maltbot is that brain with hands and a keyboard this is what we're going to be covering in this video we're going to go through how to set up and install Mulbot how to run it on a VPS on external server if you choose to do that and the options that you have to setting up your models and providers we're going to go through the web UI the terminal and also the desktop app and show you how it works and the most important part is I'm going to show you how I use it with scales and cron jobs and heartbeats then we're going to finish off with some security stuff on how to make sure your mobile is as secure as it can be to install Claudebot you come to the website claude.bot and you can choose your device if you're using a Mac you can just copy this command if you're using Windows you can click change and choose Windows and then copy this i'm using a Mac so I'm just going to copy this next thing you need to do is go to your terminal and you can open your terminal you can use that but I like to use a tool called warp.dev and it's basically an AI agent enabled terminal so even if I encounter any problems it will solve it for me so I can just copy and paste that command and I just hit enter so it'll need homebrew node and git and if you encounter problems inside warp.dev it'll help you guide you through that process as well and once it's done then it will say installed successfully the next thing you should do is come to their docs.claude.bot startwizard and the wizard helps you get started i'm going to go claudebot onboard copy this command go back to my terminal and then click and then it gives you a security notice so you say yes I understand generally I would pick quick start unless you're very familiar with how to set up a server and then here you can choose which provider you use i'm using OpenAI but I also use Google so let's try connecting to Google and you can either plug in your API key if you have anti-gravity you can choose that i'm going to select Google Gemini CLI off and it's going to go back to my account all I need to do is click here and once it's signed in it's complete i go back i'm going back into my terminal and then I can use the model that I want i'm going to choose flash preview because a lot of the tasks I'm doing are just basic business tasks so I don't need the top model and consume all my tokens so I'm just going to choose flash preview now you can choose pro if you know you want the best results and you have a lot of tokens to burn and here I can choose the channel I want to connect with and I personally use WhatsApp so I'm going to choose WhatsApp for WhatsApp I need to connect via a QR code and then you'll have to enter your telephone number and then it will use that telephone number for verification and then just choose mpm for your skills if you have some already i've already set some skills and then you can install the dependencies now if you want to give it password access you can link it to one password you can have it linked to your Apple notes your reminders and you can go through each of them and they all have a lot of cool things that each of them do and it explains what it actually does i'm not going to enable all of them because you can go back in and enable them later okay so once you've selected the skills that you want just press enter and don't worry you can skip all of it now and enable later if you wish it's now asking me to set API keys and I'm just going to leave that out for now because you can input that later and you'll need to install your gateway and the gateway is basically setting up the server so then you can connect to it and start talking to Cloudbot how do you want to hatch your bot so there's three options hatch and TUI tui means terminal user interface so I can have a chat in this terminal if I wish but I like the web UI so I'm going to open the web UI and it's going to open an interface for me on my browser and it says 127.00 so this is running locally on my machine and I can connect to it via a web interface now I've cheated a little because I've already installed this so I already have some text in there for you it should be blank and now it's complete and that's how you install Cloudbot now we're going to look into how we can use Claudebot if you're a fan of the terminal so we'll use the terminal user interface and all you need to do is go cloudbot tui and there you go you can start chatting away like you would using the web interface and it'll work just like the web dashboard the nice thing about it is that it'll actually show you how many tokens you have left so if you're very token conscious this is a good way to see your token usage as well and you can see the model that you're using now usually the TUI gives you more options than the dashboard and so if you press the slash command you'll be able to see a lot of options status agent sessions model so I can set my model if I want easily choose the one I want and there's a ton of models I can choose from and there's a lot of options here so in a later section I'll cover what these options do and that's how you use the TUI now we're going to cover how to use the desktop app if you're using a Mac there's a Mac OS app available just click on it download it and then once you've installed it you'll be greeted with this so it's got a security notice choose your gateway wizard complete and there's a lot of things I can grant i think giving it notifications is good microphone is good and once it's installed you can just go to the top bar here and click on that and you'll be able to chat with it anytime you want now that I've shown you how to install Modbot in your terminal in the web browser and on your Mac desktop I'm going to show you how to connect to WhatsApp and Telegram and control your Modbot remotely i'm going to show you how to connect to WhatsApp i realized because I already set up once it didn't show me the process to connect WhatsApp so I'll show you again i now come to channels and it's got WhatsApp and all you need to do is to scan your QR code to connect to your WhatsApp so here you see my WhatsApp and I need to click on link devices and I click link a device and then you should point your camera and scan the QR code on the screen once it's scanned it should show up as Cloudbot and then you should see a message from yourself a small issue I noticed with WhatsApp is that if I turned off my server or my computer and then I turn it back on I would lose the WhatsApp connection and then I would need to relink it again so channels that use API instead of like a a QR pairing allows you to reconnect without relinking even though you turn off your server so Telegram Discord Slack those are better channels if you envision yourself turning the server off every now and then i'm going to quickly show you how to connect Clawbot to Telegram all you need to do is open a chat with botfather enter slash newbot give it a name give it a name and then I'll get an access token so copy the token and then you can paste it into your cloudbot when you're setting up or if you're like me you're changing after you install it you can just say I want to change to cloudbot i've just shown you how to install Mobot locally on your own computer now we're going to dive into how to set up Mobot on a virtual private server on a separate server so it's more secure mobot is powerful but because of all the power you're entrusting it with it is not recommended that you run on your local computer because if someone hacks it it could be disastrous so highly recommended you run it on a virtual private server you have it running on a separate machine with its own email and passwords so the off chance it gets hacked damage is minimized luckily there are a lot of free options out there so there's basically two major routes you have your normal free options like Oracle AWS Google Cloud and Ashure and they all offer a free tier but the problem is you still need to set it up it just gives you a blank machine and you have to SSXG and you have to learn how to use the terminal to set this up but it's free there's a second option which is they have these templates where you click one button and you can deploy and so Zeber and Railways are a good example of that and with Zeber you actually get $5 credits every month and that should cover your cost so it's also free so I'm going to demo how to use Zeber and in my opinion is the easiest way to install Maltbot i just want to do a quick comparison of running Maltbot on your computer and a VPS server if you run it locally there's a higher risk but the advantage is it's free of charge but the biggest problem I noticed is that if you are running Mobot through your Telegram or WhatsApp if your computer shuts off then it doesn't work anymore with a VPS it's running 24/7 so you can always get it to work and you can have it run background test at night so that's the advantage you have more security it's safe but the downside is you have to pay but the key point I want to point out is is the mobile phone access especially with WhatsApp when I turn off and turn it back on it disconnects and I have to reconnect it again super annoying so running mobile on a VPS is the best option now there's another option though other than running locally and through a VPS you can also have it run on another computer that's not your main laptop and here I have a little Jessen Nano and it doesn't have to be super powerful and it basically I can run it on this and have mobile separate from my main daily use computer and this cost me about $200 $300 US but you can get a cheaper one i know a lot of people talk about buying a Mac Mini to run Claudebot because running Cloudbot on your own computer is very unsafe but you don't need a Mac Mini you can just get any server with minimal spec to run your Cloudbot 24/7 i'm going to teach you the easiest way to do it and it's through a website called Zeber z A B U R once you come in you can click on new project if you want to go free you can choose shared cluster and then I'm going to choose Tokyo and then I'm going to choose this free trial cluster and I'm going to choose Silicon Valley create project deploy new service choose template i'm going to choose CloudBot deploy and then give it a name and then I'm going to put in my OpenAI key and now it's working as magic and give it a sec to let it run okay now it's running and so let's go in and see how it's working so I'm getting this unauthorized gateway token missing issue so all I need to do is come in here and copy this plug into the gateway token connect and we're in business okay then I'm going to go to chat and let's give a test what's the weather in today and it's replying can get the weather i probably need to install a tool but it's working now setting up Cloudbot on a remote server is no easy task it's much harder than installing it locally on your computer so couple things you need to check number one you want to check that your health status is okay what I realize is most of the time is your gateway token not being inputed in there so make sure you put that in connect and make sure it works another thing you have to be aware of if you're like me and you're subscribed to a monthly plan you cannot use that you have to use an API just because it's difficult to authenticate using OOTH on a server but that might change and this interface sucks so what you need to do is come down here and come down to raw and you need to change your JSON file to refer to the model and agent that you're using you can ask AI to help you to figure out what you need to put in and put in your API key then you'll be able to chat with Claudebot another way to debug is you can come back to the Zebra main page and you can go to command line and you can go claude UI and basically from here you can do a lot of things you can chat in there and fix a lot of issues from the TUI the terminal interface and start typing you can add the slash command and you can do a bunch of stuff to help you debug your issues i think Zebra is the easiest one to set up and if you follow my instructions you'll basically be running it for free as well because you get $5 credits every month and I'll provide a referral link in the description so you can get extra credits too and you should be running this for free as well i just think that this is easier than AWS to run your CloudBot on because Zebra does all the work for you it basically skips the tutorial so if you want to use your monthly credits instead of the API key for your Gemini and OpenAI subscription you'll need to run the onboarding wizard one more time and from there it has a plugin to allow you to log in using Oath and you need to do that inside the commands or you can run it on AWS and run the onboarding wizard from scratch so you have more control you can ask cloudbot to control your browser for you and in order to do that you need to install the Chrome extension so what's the first thing you need to do you need to copy this command multbot browser extension install come into your terminal and then just enter and paste your cloudbot browser install right so I was still using cloudbot at the time to change names so it could be maltbot or it could be cloudbot and once you've in enter the command you'll need to follow the instructions here which is go to chrome extensions enable developer mode and then load impact and then select extension to install it so let me show you how copy this Chrome extensions and then in your Chrome browser just paste it and then you will be greeted with a page that looks like this then you need to enable developer mode on the top load unpacked and then you need to go to this folder and on Mac if you go to your folder you won't be able to see the folder because it's hidden so you pressed shift command period then you'll see the hidden files and here I see cloudbot and I go in browser Chrome extension and I just select that and once you select it you'll be greeted with this and to for it to show up you got to come to the top right and I'm going to pin it so then you can see the browser relay here and when you use it you got to turn it on and this little thing will show up that means Cloudbot has control and access to your browser so let me demo what you can do with it okay first thing I need to do is turn on the relay it's on then I give it a command and what I'm trying to do is generate some images in Gemini and it's done its thing and it's generated these images for me based on my request so it's taking control of my browser and doing stuff for me inside the browser one of the more useful capabilities is to enable web search in Maltbot and you can do that by using this Brave search API go to brave.com/arch/appi and sign up for an account you can get a free account and just subscribe and then go to API keys and generate an API key i'm going to call it maltbot i'm going to copy the key and then what do you do well you need to come into your terminal and once inside the terminal you need to use this command cloudbot configure section web and then you choose local or remote i'm choosing local and then you enable web search yes i'm going to paste in my key enable web fetch yes and now it's got web search enabled let's see what we can do with it can you search the internet for what's new with Maltbot and then let's see what it comes back with okay and it's used the web search tool and it's gone around and look for some stuff and it says here are the key findings and you've got web search enabled and now you can do a lot of research using Maltbot now we come into one of my favorite things which is skills and why do you want skills well basically if you have anything that you repeatedly prompt and you use it all the time you should turn it into a skill and it comes with a lot of pre-built skills you can just click a button here to disable and enable this is all great and good but I want to show you the capability of building your own custom skill okay one of the skills I have is to turn my transcript of my videos into a YouTube description you can see that I have a YouTube description generator and then I just paste in my transcript and it's using my skill and it's built me this really cool YouTube description now let's try to build a new skill can you build a skill for me that generates viral YouTube titles give me three to five different titles that I can choose based on the transcript that I provide the titles need to be less than 55 characters here is my transcript and it's given me five titles I can choose how to install Cloudbot stop babysitting AI Claudebot setup so these are the five titles it's given me and now it's given me a skill that I can reuse now you might think oh why do I need a skill i can just type this in every time well if I have multiple skills then I can string them together so next time I put in my transcript it can use the title generator to give me a title it can use the description skill to give me a description and I can link three or four more skills and then all of a sudden I don't need to type in what I typed in in the beginning which is can you give me three to five different titles it has to be 55 character and type a whole bunch of stuff every time the skill remembers my prompts and it just gives me what I need altogether so that's how you build new skills in Cloudbot let's say you want to get Cloudbot to control your Google calendar and your emails if you come inside skills this is a very useful skill called Google Workspace CLI for Gmail calendar drive and sheets you need to click on install Google and just wait for it to happen okay once you have it installed then you need to set up your Google so you need to come to console.cloud.google.com you need to set up a new project give it a name and then you need to click on APIs and services and then you got to enable all the things you want cloudbot to have access to so let's say I want access to Google calendar then I need to enable the Google calendar API if I want email I need to set up the email click enable and as you can see I've already enabled it once you have that you need to go to credentials then you need to create a new credential client ID and then I have a desktop app give it a name click create and then you will have your secrets that you can copy and then authorize on your computer so it can access Google calendar Gmail whatever you have enabled through Google cloud services so the command you need to run is this Google O login client ID client secret and your scopes okay okay once you plug in the command you should be granted with this page and then I'm going to give Cloudbot access and now I'm connected now let's go back to Claude and give it a try can you add a calendar event for Thursday 11 to 1:00 p.m to pick up my hard disk okay and it successfully created it so let's go to Google Calendar and it says 11 to 1:00 p.m pick up hard disk so it's got full control of my calendar right now and this is going to be useful if you want to have it read all your emails and filter it and reply you can do that using this Google skill do you have a lot of tasks in your brain and you just want to brain dump it somewhere and organize it well I use a canban board and I'm going to show you how I use Claudebot to help me manage all the tasks that I have okay so I'm going to brain dump a bunch of tasks and Claudebot is going to be smart enough to add this to my CMAN board i have a bunch of task I want you to help me to add to linear can you help dissect this brain dump of mine and then add it i need to create a customized Pokemon card for my wife for Valentine's Day i need to start planning the slides for my AI course and I need to set up an automatic system to autocode some of the new features for my products okay and then it's asked me for clarification so let's put it in just put in to my to-do list there are no timelines for them yet and the priority is kind of low for the Pokemon cards I need to collect a bunch of pictures for the slides I need to prepare material and then so I'll need some preparation for that and then for the auto coding system it's just like a system where it will take a feature that I have in mind and then implement it and I'll provide more details later okay and it's done so let's go back in and check and you can see that it's been added my Vanden Pokemon card AI core slides and I can go in and it's like collect reference photos so it's filled in all these tasks for me and so I just like split out all the things I need to do and it's in my cam board and so I can use this for coding as well i can list out all the features I want and so how do you do this in clawbot all right so this is how it works because I use linear app which is a cambore project management tool as external service how does it communicate with a computer so it communicates through an API and usually I do it through an MCP because an MCP allows my AI to talk to an external service and inside Cloudbot there's a skill called MC Porter and I at first thought great you can install MCPS in your mop and in theory MC Porter allows you to use all the skills that we've used in Clawude and OpenAI recognize it and then you can use it but after spending four or five hours struggling I realized it's really hard it's really complicated and the best way to do it is actually through Mobot skills you can go to Claude Hub or MaltHub now and do that but right now that website is down and I'm using this awesome Mobot skills GitHub repo and inside there's a lot of skills in here and I just searched for linear and it's got this linear skill you can click on it you can take a look and if you look at the code it's got all this coded in and all I need to do is basically change the API token and it will start working and this is the easiest way that I found after struggling for five hours trying to make this work using an MCP and it's got a ton of skills and it should cover most use cases now how do you use this well right now if you just use MPX CloudHub at latest and install the skill so I put in linear is it should work but CloudHub is down so I'm doing the manual installation and how do you do that it's really simple you just come to your cloud folder and there's a skills folder and then you create a folder and then you just copy that skill so you copy this skill.md file into the skill MD and you got to have a folder that is named that and then once you're inside just change your API key if you don't want to do it manually it's very simple just go back to warp and then you can say I just want to install this skill copy the link and then inside warp.dev the agent should be smart enough to copy the skill into the folder and then that's step one now step two is that after you installed it it may not work immediately so after you install the skill your cloudbot may not recognize it completely so you need to run uh maltbot or cloudbot gateway restart that way it will recognize the file and then after you run this command you can come back in and your skill should run and so there's a ton of stuff you can add and these skills are super powerful another cool feature Cloudbot has are what are called cron jobs so these are jobs that can run in the background on a regular schedule so every week every day every night why would you use this well let me give you an example i like to analyze my YouTube data to see how I can improve and get more subscribers and views and instead of just going to dashboard and just looking at a lot of metrics I ask AI to analyze it for me so I say can you analyze my YouTube data and it runs a Python script that checks all my data retrieves the data from YouTube and then it gives me some highlights but most importantly recommendations on what I can do to improve my channel and here it says you know Open Code is doing really well i should do more open code videos my retention is not looking good so like work on the first 15 seconds so these are good recommendations i don't need to purposely call Moldbot to run it every time i've scheduled it to run every single week on a Sunday at noon and then it gives me a report so I'll get a message on my WhatsApp or Telegram with recommendations on how to improve my YouTube so if you have a lot of reports or things that you want to do on a weekly basis you can schedule a cron job so I have several apps on the app store that's generating revenue one is a health data export app that allows you to export your health data to analyze using AI and I have a looks maxing app where you take a photo and it gives you a score and see how you can improve your looks and I wanted to basically grab the sales report every week in the analytics and see if there's any areas I can improve on for my apps so let's try to build that i have multiple apps on the iOS app store i want to build a cron job where it retrieves the data from the app store connect and then it gives me an analysis on how I can improve my revenue where it retrieves the data and then it analyzes and it compares my sales from previous week to this week and then it also suggests areas for improvements or notifies me if there's anything I need to fix to improve the sales and in order to retrieve this data It needs me to do some private keys and fill in my key ID issue ID so I'm going to go ahead and do that and we'll check back in when I put it in all right so I put in all the credentials and all the keys to my new cron job and I basically say can you run the app store analytics chron job okay so it's done and the cron job is completed and it says my sales dropped my impressions dropped but my conversion rate went up and that's good because I changed some of the screenshots and it's giving me some suggestions on how to improve and now if I go into cron jobs you'll see that I have two cron jobs one for YouTube one for my app store analytics and this will run on a regular schedule and that's how you set up cron jobs now that I've shown you cron jobs I want to explain another idea to you which is heartbeats what's the difference between heartbeats and cron jobs they sound technical but the difference is actually really simple craw equals fixed schedule think of cron like an alarm clock it goes off as at a specific time no matter what every day at 9:00 a.m every Friday at 5:00 p.m when the alarm rings Mobot runs the tasks you told it to run so you can have weekly reports generated which are demonstrated you can back up files nightly it runs no matter heartbeat equals periodic check-ins with judgment heartbeat is different heartbeat is like having an assistant who checks in regularly and only bothers you when something actually matters so instead of do this at 9:00 a.m it's more like every 15 minutes look at my inbox and only message me if there's something important or monitor for website changes or alert me when something happens it only notifies you when it's needed okay so how do you set up heartbeats first you got to go to your cloud folder and then you find your heartbeat.md open it in the text editor and then initially is blank and so here I've added check email for urgent messages review calendar for events next two hours if idol send me a message and a background task complete summarize results and so this is what I've added and then let's check in on what it does it was check periodically and it says it's checked my email but there's nothing important great and it's found in my calendar that I have to pick up my hard disk in 2 hours time so that's really useful and so that's what Heartbeat does it'll check your stuff and it notify you when needed and since we talked about heartbeat we can't not talk about the soul.md file so it's in the same folder and you can open the soul.md basically this is the personality of your Claudebot and the boundaries written in plain English so every time Cloudbot opens up it reads this file and it says be genuine helpful have opinions be resourceful things stay private so you can change this when you did the setup you can ask it to be funny you can be you know more direct and then I've added some more rules to it because know I'm more of like an engineer and I need a chief of staff so I'm telling it what it should act like you should be an AI chief of staff and speak like an engineer clarify questions never delete all my files and so it's just useful to set these boundaries and it's quite fun if you wanted to be a comedian you can go into AI and say "Hey I want to modify my soul to be more funny." You can do that too so worth a look into let's talk about security cloudbot maltbot can read files run shell commands control your browser send messages that means if someone gets access to gateway they basically get access to your computer i'm not just saying this to scare you security researchers have found over a thousand mobile gateways exposed on the internet and some of them have no authentication api keys are leaked chat history is exposed telegram token stolen i'm no security expert but there are some quick fixes to lock things down properly that you can implement okay I'm not a security expert but there's a couple things you can do so you can run this cloudbot security audit deep in your terminal and it will tell you if there's any critical issues you need to fix and right now I don't have any critical issues so that's good so that's one quick way of improving your security a second command you can run is cloudbotconfig setg gateway.true and basic gateway is the command center of your mbot and you reset authentication so the second thing is you want to check that your gateway has authentication so run cloudbot config get gateway and just check that your mode is on and you have authentication on and then the last thing you want to do is to kind of lock your permissions of your files and so you can have this command and run it and it'll modify the permissions of your files and I'll provide all this in the description so you can download it but these are just quick fixes that will close your most major loopholes if you want to do more you can install tail scale and create a tunnel between your devices to your server i would highly encourage you to chat with Clubbot and see how you can improve the security of your Clubbot server and here's my honest take on Maltbot after spending a 100 hours using it it's extremely powerful you can automate files generate reports research things for you and even run it on your phone while you're outside that part is genuinely impressive but it's not easy to use at all before mobile I was already doing most of these things i use Cloud Code OpenAI Codeex Perplexity Comment Browser i know how to wire APIs together i use MCPs and I actually vibe coded my own personal chief of staff that's faster safer uses less tokens and it's tailored to me what Maltbot does is put all of that into one platform one agent one gateway one place to talk to your computer and that's the real value of Mop so here are my pros and cons it's definitely not easy to set up it uses a lot of tokens it's actually slower than some of the other tools I'm using huge security risk and because it's a new and open source product some of the edge cases are just like really hard to deal with but having said that I'm thoroughly impressed by Maltbot it's one tool that does everything i love that you can control it from your phone super powerful when you integrate it with the skills and because so many people are using it I think it's going to grow really fast so it's not for an absolute beginner to use this because it's a beast if you're really hardcore then you might as well just vibe code your own product tailored to yourself without a lot of features that you never use and if you work in a corporate environment definitely don't use this because the security risk are just too much it's best for intermediate users who know how to prompt how to set up VPS but not quite there in terms of vibe coding you don't want to learn five different tools and just have one place that does everything for you and I'm going to leave with this is that I'm still going to use it because I really think this is the future because I've already built my own personal chief of staff agent Vibe Coding and I think Mobot will get much better over time if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe it will help me a lot if you want to learn more about AI you can join my free AI community in the description if you've tried Mobot yourself I'm curious about how you're finding it please share your experience in the comment see you in my community
